# From Stories to Statistics: Methodological Biases in LLM-Based Narrative Flow Quantification

Repository for the paper - "From Stories to Statistics: Methodological Biases in LLM-Based Narrative Flow Quantification" accepted at CoNLL'25.


## Setup

This code was run on `python==3.9.20`. Use pip to install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file as - 

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

The hippocorpus dataset is available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105291. For the auto-bio dataset, it can be generated by using the pipeline in `create_autobio.py` after acquiring all the books listed in the appendix.

## Workflow

To replicate the results of the paper, follow this general pipeline

1. Create the auto-bio paired dataset
2. Generate the topics (sampling randomly from either group) for the auto-bio dataset
3. Calculate sequentiality for the auto-bio dataset.
4. Analyze difference among the two groups.
5. Acquire the hippocorpus dataset and after filtering and merging, generate topics for both stories.
6. Calculate sequentiality under the different topic conditions
7. Analyze the difference among the two groups.

For the analysis part, refer to the `score_difference.ipynb` file for more details. For all the remaining parts, refer to the `README.md` within the `python_scripts` folder for further details about each script and what it entails.
